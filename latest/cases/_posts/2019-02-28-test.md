Damiani International BV v Dhamani Jewels DMCC [2020] SGIPOS 11 (decision of IP Adjudicator Jason Chan) was a trade mark opposition dispute between two parties which use their family names as trade marks in the jewellery business.
The mark sought to be registered was  (in Classes 14 and 35). The Opponent, Damiani, relied primarily on its earlier registration for the stylised Damiani trade mark in Class 14, as follows: . The opposition ultimately succeeded under s 8(2)(b) of the Trade Marks Act (which some refer to as the “confusing similarity” ground of opposition) as well as s 8(7)(a) of the Trade Marks Act (that is, passing off).
However, the opposition did not succeed under s 8(4)(b)(i) (which relates to well known trade marks) because the Opponent’s evidence disclosed use of the plain word marks “DAMIANI” but not the stylised registered mark and the IP Adjudicator was not persuaded that the stylised mark relied on was well-known in Singapore at the relevant date.
The IP Adjudicator also considered the issue of partial oppositions and came to the conclusion (stated at [66]) that the tribunal is not required, and does not have the authority, to grant partial oppositions whether or not they arise within the context of a single class or in multi-class applications.
