<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/docs/default-source/module-document/judgement/-2020-sgca-103-(v-2)-pdf.pdf">Tuitiongenius Pte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and anor</a>[2020] SGCA 103 was a dispute which arose in the context of a joint venture in the tuition business. It involved, among other things, a claim in passing off. The trial judge had dismissed the claim on passing off on the basis that there was no evidence that the appellant had any goodwill in the “TuitionGenius” trade mark. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the real question which the judge should have considered (but did not) was whether the goodwill in the business was sufficiently associated with the identifiers that it had used. While there was sufficient evidence of goodwill in the business as a whole, there was “thin” evidence of use of the “TuitionGenius” mark and all things considered the mark was not distinctive of the plaintiff/appellant’s business and therefore not sufficiently associated with the goodwill (in the business) to sustain a claim under the tort of passing off.
